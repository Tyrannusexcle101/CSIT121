            <dt>How is the site organized?</dt>
            <dd>How Khan Academy is organized is it uses hierarchical organization which
                has a home page and sections for different subjects like math and history. Also, the 
                site has sections for each different grade level.

            <dt>Which CRAP Design Principle does it use? Provide at least one example.</dt>
            <dd>One CRAP design principle that Khan Academy uses is Proximity. For example, the Social
                studies heading has different sections that teaches different types of histories which
                include Units.

                for young kids to be ready for school and gives everyone a chance to have an education
                for free.
            </dd>

            <dt>What is the site's efficiency?</dt>
            <dd>When signing up to the website, they ask you if you are a teacher, student, or parent 
                which gives them a certain level of learning they are and offers an AI tutor in case 
                people are in trouble.
            </dd>

            <dt>How is the engagement?</dt>
            <dd>The engagement I would say is efficient because kids and adults around the globe use this 
                website for educational purposes as a learning tool.
            </dd>

            <dt>Recommendation to improve the website:</dt>
            <dd>One recommendation is making a virtual chat section where they can interact 
                with other students just like a real classroom.
