    <h3>What are the uses of Controlled-Identifier's?</h3>
    <p>
      One of the Controlled-Identifiers's main uses is to verify cryptographic proofs.
      However, Controlled-Identifiers can be used for Service engagement and Extensibility.
      Extensibility can be used to extend the cases to provide new functionality. Service engagement
      can be used to publicly advertise so other people can reach each other through various
      communication services.
